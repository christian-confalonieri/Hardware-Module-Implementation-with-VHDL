This is the final test of "**Reti Logiche**", course of "**Engineering of Computing Systems**" (BSc) held at Politecnico di Milano (2021/2022).

**Professor**: William Fornaciari

**Final Score**: 30 cum laude / 30

<h2>Goal</h2>

Given a sequence of N words, each of 8 bits, and size N, the purpose of the project is to implement an hardware module, described in VHDL, that interfaces with a memory and provide the 2N words computed by a convolutional encoder.

<h2>Specifications</h2>

The module receives as input a continuous sequence of W words, each of 8 bits, and returns as output a continuous sequence of Z-words, each of 8 bits. Each of the input words input is serialized, so a continuous stream U of 1 bit is generated.

On this stream the convolutional code 1/2 is applied
(each bit is encoded with 2 bits) according to the scheme shown in the figure; this operation generates a stream as output
continuous Y stream. The Y stream is obtained as an alternating chaining of the two output bits.

The output sequence Z is the parallelization, over 8 bits, of the continuous stream Y.
